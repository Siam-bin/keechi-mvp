## Bug #1: Admin/Shop Owner Login Separation Issue ‚ùå

### Problem:
- When logging in as admin, shop owner UI elements still show
- Two separate auth systems (AdminContext + AuthProvider) not synchronized
- Header uses AuthProvider only, doesn't check AdminContext

### Root Cause:
```
Header.js uses: useAuth() from AuthProvider
Admin page uses: useAdmin() from AdminContext
These are SEPARATE and don't communicate
```

### Solution:
Modify Header.js to check BOTH authentication contexts

---

## Bug #2: Token Storage Collision

### Problem:
- `authToken` from user/shop login overwrites admin session
- `adminToken` stored separately but Header doesn't check it

### Solution:
Clear appropriate token on logout, check both contexts in Header

---

## Implementation:

### Step 1: Update Header to check both auth contexts

Header.js should:
1. Check AdminContext first (if user is admin)
2. Then check AuthProvider (if user is shopOwner/user)
3. Show appropriate header based on role

### Step 2: Update logout functions

Both AdminContext and AuthProvider should clear their tokens properly

### Step 3: Add role clear on logout

When logging out, clear the user role state
